<h1>Otto's Story</h1>
<p>Otto was a very aggresive dog when we first got him. Great Phyrese are bred to protect livestock, so he naturally wanted to attack every dog he saw. He was our first foster dog, so we only had him for one week. He came from many owners who didn't know what to do with such a massvie dog. He eventually found a home with a livestock owner, and now gets to protect sheep just like he was meant too. He is super happy!</p>
