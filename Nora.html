<h1>Nora's Story</h1>
<p>Nora came to us from a older women who could not handle a aggresive dog. To socialize her, we took her to the path that walks along the dog park so she could get used to dogs but still feel safe. We also took her to the beach where she could be off leash to feel more comfortable. She had around 5 people intrested in her, but everytime she would shut herself off to the family. Around my birthday, my dad suprirsed me with a special suprise. We adopted her! And I love her so much to this day. Right now, you can find us sitting on the deck doing our homework, or going for a run or walk along the water.</p>
