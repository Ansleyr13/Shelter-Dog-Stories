<h1>Nora's Story</h1>
<p>Nora came to us from a older women who could not handle a aggresive dog. To socialize her, we took her to the path that walks along the dog park so she could get used to dogs but still feel safe. We also took her to the beach where she could be offleash to feel more comfortable. She had around 5 people intrested in her, but everytime she would shut herself off to the family. Eventually, we adopted her! .</p>
