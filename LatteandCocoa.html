<h1>Latte and Cocoa's Story</h1>
<p>Latte and Cocoa came to us dog aggresive but so so sweet to humans. Pit Bull's get such a bad rap about being dangerous but these two were the sweetest ever. They were bonded, meaning they wouldn't leave each others side. We also discovered they were sisters, and both mothers while they were strays. </p>
