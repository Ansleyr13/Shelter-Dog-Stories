<h1>Latte and Cocoa's Story</h1>
<p>Latte and Cocoa came to us dog aggresive but so so sweet to humans. Pit Bull's get such a bad rap about being dangerous but these two were the sweetest ever. They were bonded, meaning they wouldn't leave each others side. We also discovered they were sisters, and both mothers while they were strays. My favoirte memory with these two was taking them to this little beach near our house late at night, and letting them run around offleash by themselves until they could baraly walk anymore. They were so happy, and eventually found a family with two kids to enjoy the rest of life with.  </p>
