	<h1>Shelter Dog Stories</h1>
	<p>Many perfectly amazing dogs are left stuck in shelters for their entire life without someone giving them a second chance. Some were abused, strays, in neglecting homes, or so many other things. There is a huge misconnception that shelter dogs are harder to train, or aggressive. That is a total lie. Many shelter dogs are actually more loving or happy than the average dog. Many are very affectionate, and truly show you their gratefulness for giving them antoher chance. </p>


	<p> I have given 4 special dogs a second chance through fostering and adotpion and I wanted to share their stories. Enjoy! I hope this inspries you to help a life today. </p>
